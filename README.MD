# Discrete math 2022 laboratory work 1

As a result of laboratory work, we:  
- Implemented an automatic calculation of the minimum frame of the weighted graph using the algorithms of Prima and Kruskal, which were implemented by us. A comparison of the speed of their work depending on the number of nodes in the graph was performed.
- Implemented MyDecisionTreeClassifier model

## Installation
